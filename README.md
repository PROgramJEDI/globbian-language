# the Globbian Language ðŸ”¢
The Globbian Language is a new musical language that was designed by Tamir Globus in 2022. The language uses existing operations and structures from mathematics to instruct the player how to read the notes and the writer how to write them. Three-dimensional Vectors are used to define notes with three properties: **type**, **octave**, and **time**. The **time** of the note is for how many counts it should be played. The 0th octave is the octave of middle-C. The **octave** of the note is written relative to the 0th octave, such that higher pitches octaves have a positive value, and lower ones have negative ones. The existing note **types** are C, C#, D, D#, and so on. Based on the assumption that the middle-C note is existent, we define the other types relative to it, such as E = C + 2, F = C + 2.5, etc.
